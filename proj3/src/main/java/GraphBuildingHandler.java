/**
 *  Parses OSM XML files using an XML SAX parser. Used to construct the graph of roads for

 *  <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Way">the way XML element</a>,

 *
 *  You may find the CSCourseGraphDB and CSCourseGraphDBHandler examples useful.
 *
 *  The idea here is that some external library is going to walk through the XML
 *  file, and your override method tells Java what to do every time it gets to the next
 *  element in the file. This is a very common but strange-when-you-first-see it pattern.
 *  It is similar to the Visitor pattern we discussed for graphs.
