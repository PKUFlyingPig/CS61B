 * This class provides a shortestPath method for finding routes between two points
 * on the map. Start by using Dijkstra's, and if your code isn't fast enough for your
 * satisfaction (or the autograder), upgrade your implementation by switching it to A*.
 * Your code will probably not be fast enough to pass the autograder unless you use A*.
 * The difference between A* and Dijkstra's is only a couple of lines of code, and boils
 * down to the priority you use to order your vertices.
